# Flatfish: A React Chess App

Flatfish is a React chess app that supports both casual gameplay and solo practice. Users can play against a random move engine, load or manually set up board scenarios, and save or resume games. The application supports PGN and FEN imports and exports for easy game sharing and loading.

Flatfish uses [React Chessboard](https://github.com/Clariity/react-chessboard) for graphics, [Chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js) for game logic, and [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to simulate a backend.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 


## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Start the server with 'npm run server'
3. Run 'npm start' to open the app in your browser
